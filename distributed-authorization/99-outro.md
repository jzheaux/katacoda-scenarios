### Congratulations

Wow, nice job!

Over these four scenarios, you've been able to dive deep into Spring Security as well as secure design in general.

Here are some things to think about:

* The front-end could be better. It would be nice to not have the token in the browser at all. Is there a way to keep our SPA and still store the token securely on the backend?
* The token could be more secure. JWTs contain attributes in plain text that we might not want clients to see. Can we prevent that from happening without losing functionality?

### What's Next?

Stay tuned for more scenarios down the road that will address these questions!
