### Congratulations

You did it!

The REST API now enforces authorization rules based on the user in context.

### What's Next?

A common use of a REST API is to query it inside a browser-based application.
The next scenario `CORS and CSRF with REST APIs in Spring Security`, you'll add a front end and the necessary security checks.

You'll also see some limitations that HTTP Basic brings to this approach.
